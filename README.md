# CNN-Cancer-Prediction

Dataset: The folder “Dataset2” contains 2 folders, the “FNA” named folder contains 2 more folders ( ‘benign’ folder contains image datas for 1074 benign cases and ‘malignant’ folder contains image datas for 650 malignant cases).

Overview: 1. Preprocessing of given labelled image datas (inside ‘FNA’ files).

2. Train and validate your model (CNN) with those preprocessed images.

3. Estimate and plot training and validation loss and accuracy function.

4. Fit the unlabelled images from file ‘test’ to your model and predict malignant or benign.

Objective: A. The folder “test” inside folder “Dataset2” contains unlabelled 14 images. Predict benign or malignant for those cases. [Use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) OR any other deep neural network for training purpose].

B. Evaluate the model accuracy and loss function.
